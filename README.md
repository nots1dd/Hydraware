A cross-platform solution toward a more hydro-knolwedgable world.

## Aim
- To give the user a quick and easy overview of the fresh water supply and hydrological analysis of their locality with the help of governmental organisations like National Institute of Hydrology along with Machine Learning to predict any future shortages
- Effortless access of important announcements through push notifications
- Build a gap between water suppliers and the populace
- Give users an understanding of the water network in their area (includes STP, water processing so on)

Hydraware bridges the gap between water networks and the public, promoting transparency and responsible water use. Imagine understanding your water's journey from source to treatment, participating in discussions about sustainable practices, and receiving alerts about potential outages â€“ all within a single, user-friendly app.

## Future plans
